Date ->Wed, 30 Jan 2019 21:26:05 GMT
	This is the date and time the request is made.
Cache-Control ->private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
	These are settings for the cache mechanisms from the server to the client. Max-age=0 means don't cache.
ETag ->"IUREzboS_XZycecz4xfru1ipYfo/Um415Jojty9M3_pWtHlSjxS2zcQ"
	The ETag HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource.
Vary ->Origin
	Tells downstream proxies how to match future request headers to decide whether the cached response can be used rather 
	than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.
	Considered the most efficient form of caching.
Vary ->X-Origin
	Custom proprietary headers can be added using the 'X-' prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012, 
Content-Type ->application/json; charset=UTF-8
	represents the formatting style of the response data
Content-Encoding ->gzip
	This encodes the content with compression in zip form.
X-Content-Type-Options ->nosniff
	This makes it unable to sniff packets.
X-Frame-Options ->SAMEORIGIN
	Clickjacking protection:  sameorigin - no rendering if origin mismatch, 
X-XSS-Protection ->1; mode=block
	This prevents xss attacks.
Server ->GSE
	A name for the server.
Alt-Svc ->quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="44,43,39"
	indicate that its resources can also be accessed at a different network location (host or port) or using a different protocol
Transfer-Encoding ->chunked
	The form of encoding used to safely transfer the entity to the user. 
	In chunked transfer encoding, the data stream is divided into a series of non-overlapping "chunks". 
	The chunks are sent out and received independently of one another. 
	No knowledge of the data stream outside the currently-being-processed chunk is necessary for both the sender and the receiver at any given time.
